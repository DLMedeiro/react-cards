# React Cards - Playing card and Pokemon card display

Check it out at: https://dlmedeiro.github.io/react-cards/

This app uses two APIs, the [Deck of Cards API](http://deckofcardsapi.com/)  and the [Pokemon API](https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/), to generate different types of cards on the page.

The intent of this application is to practice REACT hooks to reduce duplicate code when pulling card information __useAxios__ and when flipping over cards __useFlipCard__.
